Get into purr city...

Welcome to Purr City - the semi utopian world of animals. 

1.You passed the purr city gatekeeper - you know our ways. You need 3 purr coins to enter.  But you don't have them.  The cat won't let you in.

(i) You have a chicken drumstick - what do you do?  Give it to the cat - it eats it. 
(ii) it still looks at you.  you stroke it on its head and it rolls over on its stomach.

(iii) The cat opens the door for you.

Purr City - only for cats.

2. Cat Gandolf appears - and states  - welcome - you've discovered Purr City. 
Generally, humans aren't allowed.  THey are clumsy and destroy things.  We welcome curiosity though, and will let you come in and see our world - on the condition that you are respectful to it. 

Your decision:

Yes - enter
No - go back

Pick an avatar - what kind of cat do you want to be. 

3.  Purr City was built on certain foundations. Justice - hard work, and play. 

All cats were 


You cross the road....wait with the cats for the lights to be green..green cat flashing.  Cats on environmentally friendly electric scooters. 



You wait...a cat joins you, sits and wait.  You cross over together.  
City map.

Welcome human.  Your kind has visited us before.  Humans are well known for destroying things they find.  

Humans cannot enter Purr City in their physical form.  Too clumsy and will break things.  The world is designed for cats. 

For centuries, we stayed quiet apart from the occasional miaows. Then some of us broke away and formed a city. 

We allow you into Purr City to discover new things and enrich your human world with our thinking.  Your aim - to make Purr City a better place to live with your ideas. At Purr City, we welcome innovation.  Curiosity made the cat. 

However, if you break things - we will have to show you the cat flap out. And you will stay in your cat form when you leave as retribution.  We do not tolerate human destruction.  We have noticed for centuries, humans have destroyed their own habitats as well as others.  Their greed and self-centredness knows no bounds.   

You will have to use your feline wit and curiosity to explore Purr City.

Choose your avatar. 

Several cats to choose from....

You have energy levels to keep up - you need to eat and drink. 


You turn around and see three statues.  What do they say?
In Latin:

Sapentia, pax, fraternitas - cat statues. 

You see some dirt on the statues and you can't read it properly:  what do you do?

What does Sapentia mean in Latin:  (1) Wisdom, (2) Knowledge (3) Cat food

Pax (1) Peace (2) power (3) paw

fraternitas (1) 

Well done.  You have reconnected with the language of our forebears and their associated wisdom which is part of Purr City's rich heritage.

If you clear it up - there is a purr coin underneath the foilage. If you walk past, no purr coins. 

1.  Clear it up - get purr community badge award and a purr coin.  Well done on being a good citizen and cleaning up the statue!  You are making Purr City a cleaner, tidier and more attractive place to live. 

2.  Walk past - no purr coins.  

You leave with 6 purr coins - get on the bus to the centre. 

You put a paw on the reader (Digipaw reader)  It reads how many purr coins you have and deducts one.   You sit in special cat seats (sunken seats)
