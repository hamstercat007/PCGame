			<h2 align="center">What is a cat?</h2>

			
			<p>Binomial name (scientific name):<b><i> Felis Catus</i></b></p>
			<p>In Latin, <b><em>bi</em></b> means two or both, and <b><em>nomen</b></em> means name.  All animals have a scientific Latin name with two parts to it.</p>Sometimes cats are also called felines and this comes from its Latin name <b><em>felis</b></em>.

		<h2>Characteristics</h2>
		<ul style="font-size:20px">
			<li>small, furry and carnivorous mammals (carnivorous comes from the Latin words <b><em>caro</em></b> which means meat and 
				<b><em>vorare</em></b> which means to devour/eat; a carnivore is a meat-eater.)</li>
			<li>strong flexible bodies</li>
			<li>sharp retractable claws</li>

		<p>  Cats are intelligent and we are able to be a friend and helper to mankind.  
		 We can hear sounds too high in frequency for humans, making us adept to catching mice  whereas they are too slow and clumsy. We can see in the dark, and we have an acute sense of smell.</p>
	

		<h2>Domestication</h2>
		<p>We were domesticated from the Wildcat species 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, Egypt.  We roamed around as fearless hunters.  We would outrun dogs, eat fresh berries and pin down chickens.  We had no home to call our own until domestication but we survived. Domesticate comes from the Latin word <b><em>domus</em></b> meaning house; in this case it means bringing cats under human control and in the house for company and/or to carry out tasks like catching mice. <!--..until the age of the automobile.--></p> 

		<!--<h2>Respected and revered in Ancient Egypt</h2>
		<p>The Ancient Egyptians recognised that we were a helper to mankind.  Our speed and prowess enabled us to kill mice which ate the royal granaries. We were brave and killed snakes for them.</p>
		<p>When a member of our species died, the entire household went into mourning, just like a human relative.  They would shave their eyebrows to show their loss and respect for us.  </p>-->
