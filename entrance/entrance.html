				<input type="radio" name="option" value="The cat drinks it and smiles">You give it milk<br/>

				<input type="radio" name="option" value="The cat eats it and smiles"> You give it the chicken<br />

(i) Go to
			Action 1 - give it milk/chicken

			Action 2- give it milk or chicken

			The cat must be fed both milk or chicken in order to sneak in.

			If you stroke it without feeding it both milk and chicken, it will miaow and look at you expectantly and sniff at your bag.


			You stroke it under the chin and belly.  It rolls over and purrs.  A purr coin comes out of its mouth.

			 Now you have three purr coins. The cat gets up and continues through the cat flap to Purr City and beckons you to follow.

			You put it through the slot - human entrance - 3 purr coins.....welcome to Purr City.  The human gate opens.--> </p>

			<p>No cats were harmed in this production. </p>
